## Lab 1A: Artemis 
In this lab, we installed and tested tested the Arduino IDE, including the corresponding libraries required to connect the RedBoard Artemis Nano that we will be using throughout the semester. 

### Prelab
I already had the latest major version of the Arduino IDE version 2.3.4 installed from previous classes. I just had to install the ArduinoBLE library to proceed with the lab.

### Task 1: Hook up the Artemis Board

### Task 2: Blink

As per lab instruction, I directly used the blink example code (File->Examples->01.Basics/Blink) from Arduino, which simply makes the built-in LED toggle its state every second. This was a promising first demonstration that the Artemis was able to connect to my laptop and that the IDE environment works. Below is a video showing the Artemis LED blinking.

### Task 3: Serial Print

Next, I verified two way serial communication using the example code (File->Examples->Apollo3/Example04_Serial). The code makes it so that any input typed into the serial monitor would be echoed back. The only configuration I had to change was my baud rate, which needed to be 115200 as specified in the code. Below is a screenshot of the Serial monitor showing a very specific message to demonstrate that it was an input from me, which the Artemis echoed back.

### Task 4: Temperature Sensor

The next task was to use the example code (File->Examples->Apollo3/Example02_AnalogRead). The code uses the Arduino analogRead() method to read the analog voltage level corresponding to temperature, then prints it to serial. Below is a video of me palming the board, which causes the temperature reading to increase.

### Task 5: Microphone

The final task in Lab 1A was to use the example code (File->Examples->PDM/Example1_MicrophoneOutput) to print the highest frequency detected from the microphone aboard the Artemis. To verify this, I snapped into the microphone, which produces a much higher-frequency sound than the ambient noise in the lab. Below is a video showing the Arduino output as I snapped.
