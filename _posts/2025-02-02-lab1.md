## Lab 1A: Artemis 
In this lab, we installed and tested tested the Arduino IDE, including the corresponding libraries required to connect the RedBoard Artemis Nano that we will be using throughout the semester. 

### Prelab
I already had the latest major version of the Arduino IDE version 2.3.4 installed from previous classes. I just had to install the ArduinoBLE library to proceed with the lab.

As per lab instruction, I directly used the blink example code from Arduino. This was a promising first demonstration that the Artemis was able to connect to my laptop and that the IDE environment works.
