Hello! My name is Jeffery, currently a senior undergraduate student at Cornell, majoring in Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Computer Science. I have a deep passion for robotics because it intertwines my two biggest technical interests. Particularly, my research interests are in human-robot interaction and assistive robotics. I hope that one day I can apply my skillset to help the elderly and physically impaired people in my life. I love being able to work towards a project where I can see the outcome and the impact that it has on people!
